# Installation
You will need the standard data science libraries found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues with Python3.

# Project motivation
In this project, I aim to assess how well the strain distribution dataset can be used to predict crack presence with logistic regression and random forest algorithms. 

# File discription
- data_modelling.ipyn: a notebook containing the data preparation and modelling process

# Licencing, Authors and Acknowlegement
- Credits should be given to the [DASML](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/organisation/departments/dasml) where fatigue tests are performed to collect strain distribution dataset.
